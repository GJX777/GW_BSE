     Number of MPI processes:                64
     Threads/MPI process:                     1

     MPI processes distributed on     2 nodes
     R & G space division:  proc/nbgrp/npool/nimage =      64
     484645 MiB available memory on the printing compute node when the environment starts


     Reading xml data from directory:

     ./out/MOSE2_WS2.save/

     IMPORTANT: XC functional enforced from input :
     Exchange-correlation= PBE

     WARNING: kgrid is set to zero in the wavefunction file.
              The resulting file will only be usable as the fine grid in inteqp.
