     Parallel version (MPI & OpenMP), running on     640 processor cores
     Number of MPI processes:               320
     Threads/MPI process:                     2

     MPI processes distributed on    10 nodes
     489971 MiB available memory on the printing compute node when the environment starts

     Reading input from scf.in

     Current dimensions of program PWSCF are:
     Max number of different atomic species (ntypx) = 10
     Max number of k-points (npk) =  40000
     Max angular momentum in pseudopotentials (lmaxx) =  4
     Message from routine setup:
     using ibrav=0 with symmetry is DISCOURAGED, use correct ibrav instead

     K-points division:     npool     =      16
     R & G space division:  proc/nbgrp/npool/nimage =      20
     Subspace diagonalization in iterative solution of the eigenvalue problem:
     a serial algorithm will be used

     Message from routine divide_et_impera:
     suboptimal parallelization: some nodes have no k-points
