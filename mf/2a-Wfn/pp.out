     Parallel version (MPI & OpenMP), running on      64 processor cores
     Number of MPI processes:                64
     Threads/MPI process:                     1

     MPI processes distributed on     2 nodes
     R & G space division:  proc/nbgrp/npool/nimage =      64
     488854 MiB available memory on the printing compute node when the environment starts


     Reading xml data from directory:

     ./out/MOSE2_WS2.save/

     IMPORTANT: XC functional enforced from input :
     Exchange-correlation= PBE
                           (   1   4   3   4   0   0   0)
     Any further DFT definition will be discarded
     Please, verify this is what you really want
